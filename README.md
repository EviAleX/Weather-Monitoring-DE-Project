# Real-Time Weather Data Streaming and Analytics Platform

This project demonstrates an end-to-end, real-time data engineering solution built on Microsoft Azure and Fabric. The pipeline ingests live weather data from an external API, processes it in real-time, and visualizes the insights through interactive Power BI dashboards.

## üèõÔ∏è**Architecture Overview**

The architecture is designed for low-latency, high-throughput data processing, leveraging a modern, event-driven approach.

**Core technologies**:
- **Data Ingestion**: Azure Functions & Azure Event Hub & Databricks
- **Real-Time Processing**: Microsoft Fabric (EventStream, KQL Database)
- **Alerting**: Microsoft Fabric (Data Activator)
- **Business Intelligence**: PowerBI
- **Security**: Azure Key Vault

## üöÄ**Pipeline Workflow**

The data flows through the system in four key stages:

### 1. **Data Ingestion (The Producer)**

- An **Azure Function**, triggered by a timer every 30 seconds, acts as the data producer.

- The function securely retrieves an API key from **Azure Key Vault**.
- It calls a live weather API to fetch current conditions, forecasts, and alerts for a specified location.

- The raw JSON response is flattened and cleaned within the Python script to create a structured, single-level event.
- This processed event is then sent to an **Azure Event Hub**, which serves as the entry point for our streaming data.

### 2. **Real-Time Processing (The stream)**

- A **Microsoft Fabric EventStream** is configured to listen to the Azure Event Hub.
- As data arrives, the EventStream ingests it and routes it directly to a **KQL Database (EventHouse)**. This database is optimised for high-speed ingestion and querying of time-series data.

### 3. **Monitoring & Alerting**

- **Microft Fabric's Data Activator** continuously monitors the data in the KQL Database. 
- It is configured with specific triggers (if there is any weather alert) to send out real-time alerts, enabling proactive responses to changing weather conditions.

---

### 4. **Visualisation & Reporting**

- **PowerBI** connects directly to the KQL Database in DirectQuery mode.
- This allows for the creation of powerful, interactive dashboards that visualise the weather data in near real-time providing stakeholders with up-to-the-second insights.
